# knowledge_network
My thoughts on how we could use machines to share knowledge.

## base pillars

knowledge format:
- atomicity: every claim is as atomic as possible
- composibility: claim can refer to other claims
- recursivity: structure is able to describe itself

reasoning

proofs and witnesses

claminification assistant
- user submit claims in natural language
- assistant extract and suggest corresponding claims
- user ajusts and confirms claims 

only text data

knowledge unification via:
- normalization
- pattern bots

attention points:
- this is an important knowledge for me
- this is an important knowledge in context of ...
- I'm courious about this

feed:
- customizable
- transparent algorithms

everything has a source , can be a person

## sharing
- openness and interconnectivity
- guids
- sharing publicly
- sharing with friends
- sharing when possible to anonymize
- sharing via crypto heavy hammers (recursive ZKPs and PSI)

## business
- selling storage
- selling search capability like open GPT
- selling product forms, i.e. "I use x" claims
- donations / premium
